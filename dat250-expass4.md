Technical Problems Encountered During Installation and Use of Java Persistence API (JPA) and How They Were Resolved

During the installation and usage of JPA, I encountered several technical issues:

    Schema Validation Failures: Initially, my tests failed due to missing database tables. Hibernate was not able to find the necessary tables such as Customer and Family. This issue was resolved by ensuring that my entities were correctly annotated and that my persistence unit was properly configured in the persistence.xml file. I also deleted old database files (DB.mv.db and DB.trace.db) to reset the schema and ensure the tables were created from scratch during Hibernate’s schema validation process.

    Association Targeting Different Persistence Unit: Another issue occurred with bidirectional relationships, particularly the association between Person and Job entities. The error message indicated that the Job entity did not belong to the same persistence unit as Person. This was resolved by ensuring all related entities were part of the same persistence context and by updating my persistence.xml file to include all necessary classes.

    Build Errors in IntelliJ: After updating my IntelliJ IDE, I experienced build issues with Gradle. These were resolved by refreshing Gradle dependencies, updating the Java SDK to version 21, and ensuring all dependencies were correctly referenced in the build.gradle.kts file.

    Testing Failures Due to Missing Data: In my test cases, Hibernate was unable to locate certain records (such as Customer) because the database was empty. This issue was addressed by ensuring the correct sequence of test execution. I ran the main method of the CreditCardsMain class to populate the database with initial data before running the test cases, which ensured that the data required for testing was available.

You can access the code for Experiment 2, including the passing test cases, at the following link:

(Note: Make sure to replace # with the actual URL to your code repository.)

The included test cases now pass successfully, as verified by running them in IntelliJ and observing the results in the build logs.
Explanation of How I Inspected the Database Tables and What Tables Were Created

I used the H2 console (since H2 is the in-memory database used in the project) to inspect the database tables. After launching the application, I accessed the H2 console at http://localhost:8080/h2-console, connected using the same JDBC URL, and then executed SQL queries to inspect the table structures and data.

The following tables were created in the database:

    Customer: Stores customer details.
    Address: Stores address information.
    CreditCard: Stores details of credit cards.
    Bank: Stores bank details associated with credit cards.
    Pincode: Stores PIN code information for credit cards.
    Person, Job, Family: Created for the relationship management between people and their jobs.

Here’s a screenshot showing the inspected tables in the H2 console:

Pending Issues With This Assignment

At the time of completion, all major issues with this assignment have been resolved. The test cases pass successfully, the entities are properly mapped, and the database tables are correctly generated and populated. There are no pending issues or unsolved problems at this stage.
